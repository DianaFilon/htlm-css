              Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
              looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to
              <span class="underline">their own section</span>
              . Continue reading for an introduction to the documentation,
              Native Components, React, and more!

              React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
              iOS applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native
              capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
              platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
              of your UI using React components:
              <em>bundles of reusable, nestable code</em> . You can learn more
              about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how
              components work in React Native.

            <p class="text-react">
              React Native runs on <span class="underline">React</span>, a
              popular open source library for building user interfaces with
              JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to
              understand React itself. This section can get you started or can
              serve as a refresher course.
            </p>
            <p class="text-react">
              We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
            </p>
            <p class="text-react">
              <strong>+ components.</strong> The rest of this introduction to
              React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures
              that need names and a cafe to work in.
            </p>
            <p class="text-react">
              <strong>+ JSX.</strong> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax
              that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
              <span class="back">
                &lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat! &lt;Text&gt;</span
              >.
            </p>
            <p class="text-react">
              The React docs have
              <span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you
              can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can
              use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
              <span class="back">name</span> for the cat, name, and embedding it
              with curly braces inside
              <span class="back"> &lt;Text&gt;</span>
            </p>
            <p class="text-react">
              <strong>+ props.</strong> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
            </p>
            <p class="text-react">
              <strong>+ state. </strong> While you can think of props as
              arguments you use to configure how components render, state is
              like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for
              handling data that changes over time or that comes from user
              interaction. State gives your components memory!
            </p>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <h1 class="title">handling text input</h1>
            <p class="text-react">
              TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text.
              It has an <em>onChangeText </em> prop that takes a function to be
              called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop
              that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
            </p>
            <p class="text last">
              For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
              their words into a different language. In this new language, every
              single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello
              there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
